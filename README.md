# Digital Voltmeter

A 4.5 digit digital voltmeter with a seven segment display

* Based on TI's TLC7135 IC
* Four different voltage ranges    
    * 200 mV
    * 2 V
    * 20 V
    * 200 V
* Overrange status LED
* Requires 5 V power input over micro USB 


## Tools Used
**Schematic Design:** OrCAD 16.2  
**PCB Layout: Cadence** Allegro

## Further Improvements
* Investigating alternate IC's for the project
* Adding auto-ranging capability
* Converting the design into a 4.5 digit digital multimeter by adding current and resistance measurement and continuity testing capabilities
* Replacing seven segment display with an LCD display
* Adding data logging capabilities
